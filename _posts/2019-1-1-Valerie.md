Valerie, a painter from Milwaukee, took me in her journey in art and life. She was born into a family of Ukrainian origins --- her father was a refugee who escaped labor camps in Germany after World War II; her mother was born in the US to a Ukrainian immigrant family. Valerie grew up understanding that there is always something terrible happening somewhere in the world. She is currently considering writing a book on the *'enforced famine'* in Ukraine.
