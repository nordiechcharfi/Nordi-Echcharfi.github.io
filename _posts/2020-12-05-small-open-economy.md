What does *'small open economy'* mean?
Economists rely on different criteria (e.g. Income Level, Human Development, Natural Resource Richness etc.) to classify the world's economies. Sometimes they use more than one criterion to think about a group of countries. In the literature on *International Macro* a large number of countries are considered as Small Open Economies (SOEs hereafter). So, what does it mean for a country to be a SOE? How does it matter to be such? And what are the main features of these SOEs?   
According to Guerron-Quintana (2013), ?a country is considered a small open economy when it takes as given the interest rate on its debt? p.10. A **SOE** is SMALL enough to lack any influence on the international market of debt. In this regard, the concept of SOE is very close to a fundamental assumption in Microeconomics. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price-takers: there is a large number of small firms so that no firm can dictate or even influence the market price. From this perspective, assuming that the international market of debt is a perfectly competitive market, it can be concluded that SOEs are also price (interest rate) takers.
