What does ?small open economy? means?
Economists rely on different criteria (e.g. Income Level, Human Development, Natural Resource Richness etc.) to classify the world?s economies. Sometimes they use more than one criterion to think about a group of countries. In the literature on International Macro a large number of countries are considered as Small Open Economies (SOEs hereafter). So, what does it mean for a country to be a SOE? How does it matter to be such? And what are the main features of these SOEs?   
According to Guerron-Quintana (2013), ?a country is considered a small open economy when it takes as given the interest rate on its debt? p.10. A SOE is SMALL enough to lack any influence on the international market of debt. In this regard, the concept of SOE is very close to a fundamental assumption in Microeconomics. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price-takers: there is a large number of small firms so that no firm can dictate or even influence the market price. From this perspective, assuming that the international market of debt is a perfectly competitive market, it can be concluded that SOEs are also price (interest rate) takers.
