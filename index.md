I am economist at Bank-AlMaghrib (the central bank of Morocco). I am  a final year doctoral candidate in Economics at Mohammed-V University of Rabat. I have been awarded the Fulbright Joint Supervision doctoral grant (2017/2018). I work under the supervision of Professors [Rebecca Neumann](https://uwm.edu/economics/people/neumann-rebecca/) (UW-Milwaukee) and Lahcen Oulhaj (Mohammed-V University of Rabat). My dissertation focuses on the macroeconomic effects of capital account openness on developing economies.
