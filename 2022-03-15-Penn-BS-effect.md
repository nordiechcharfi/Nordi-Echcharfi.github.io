This volume is dedicated to the memory of Jacques Polak, one of the last surviving participants in the Bretton Woods conference and a former Research Director and Economic Counselor at the International Monetary Fund. He was a member of the Advisory Committee of the Peterson Institute for International Economics from 1985 to 2004 and advised our publication International Economic Insights for several years. He was perhaps best known for having invented the “Polak model,” which showed that, subject to certain specified conditions, a country with a fixed exchange rate would ultimately have a payments deficit equal to the size of domestic credit expansion, which subsequently became the basis for the standard IMF program. Jacques might not have endorsed everything in this volume but his abiding intellectual curiosity would surely have demanded that he understand the argument.
