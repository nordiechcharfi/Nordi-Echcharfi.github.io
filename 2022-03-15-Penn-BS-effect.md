It has always been a dream of mine to study in the United States.
When I discovered the Fulbright Program, I began to work towards 
this goal by enrolling in English courses to improve my English 
and get a high score on the TOEFL. I discovered something fascinating 
with mastering the English language. That is, if you are curious enough,
you can acquire knowledge on literally any subject or field. The internet
provides an astonishing amount of resources and materials in English, for free.
Reading in English has not only increased my knowledge in my discipline of study, 
Economics, but has also broadened my area of research.
